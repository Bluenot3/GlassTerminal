### Welcome to the **glass-and-crystal terminal**  
Here, code isn’t just written — it’s **sculpted**. This project is a **next-gen code generator** that transforms text into a **living, reflective 3D environment**. Code streams across glowing cubes, pyramids, pillars, and spheres, each surface acting as a crystalline canvas of logic.

✨ **Key Features**  
- **Crystal surfaces** – transparent layers for stacked code streams  
- **Steel + matte planes** – solid grounding for readability  
- **Reflective metallic edges** – mirror running processes in real-time  
- **Glowing highlights** – pulsing feedback synced with code execution  
- **Shape switching** – cube, pyramid, pillar, or sphere environments  
- **File export** – save both generated code and 3D session snapshots  

🔮 **Why?**  
This isn’t just an editor. It’s a **holographic code forge** — a tool for:  
- Creative coders blending art and dev  
- Educators making abstract concepts visual  
- Futurists reimagining what an IDE can be
